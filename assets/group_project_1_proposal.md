Project Title: Now Playing
Team: Anthony Ngu, Ashley Jimenez, Trevis Thomas
Description: A website that shows you the most popular TV Shows and Movies and their rating, synopsis, cast, trailer link and a collection of review scores. Also, a search feature that lets you pull up any movie/TV show youï¿½d like to know more about.
APIs: OMDB (for movie/TV Show information); TrailerAddict (for movie/TV Show trailers).
Tasks: 
1. Create four hmtl files: Index, Movies, TV, and Dynamic.
a. Index will be our landing page with an intro and links to our favorites movies/shows.
i. All four will have a nav bar with a link to movies, tv and dynamic (search).
b. Movies will have two cards that display the most popular movies in theatres and the most popular movies that are now on DVD/streaming (this will be static and not dynamic for now, to keep the project manageable).
c. TV will have two cards listing the most popular TV shows on air as well as the most popular classic TV shows (also static and not dynamic).
d. Dynamic will have multiple cards for the poster, review scores, rating, year, cast, synopsis and a link to a movie trailer. Any time a search is run or a link is clicked on on another page, an API call is run with the term for the search/link and fills the dynamic page with the relevant info.
